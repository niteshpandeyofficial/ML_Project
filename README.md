## Problem Statement

To build a regression model to predict the visibility distance based on the given different climatic indicators in the training data.

## Data Description
This dataset predicts the visibility distance based on the different indicators as below:

1.	VISIBILITY - Distance from which an object can be seen.
2.	DRYBULBTEMPF-Dry bulb temperature (degrees Fahrenheit). Most commonly reported standard temperature.
3.	WETBULBTEMPF-Wet bulb temperature (degrees Fahrenheit).
4.	DewPointTempF-Dew point temperature (degrees Fahrenheit).
5.	RelativeHumidity-Relative humidity (percent).
6.	WindSpeed-Wind speed (miles per hour).
7.	WindDirection-Wind direction from true north using compass directions.
8.	StationPressure-Atmospheric pressure (inches of Mercury; or ‘in Hg’).
9.	SeaLevelPressure- Sea level pressure (in Hg).
10.	Precip	Total-precipitation in the past hour (in inches).
