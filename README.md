## Problem Statement

To build a regression model to predict the visibility distance based on the given different climatic indicators in the training data.

## Data Description
This dataset predicts the visibility distance based on the different indicators as below:

1.	VISIBILITY - Distance from which an object can be seen.
2.	DRYBULBTEMPF-Dry bulb temperature (degrees Fahrenheit). Most commonly reported standard temperature.
3.	WETBULBTEMPF-Wet bulb temperature (degrees Fahrenheit).
4.	DewPointTempF-Dew point temperature (degrees Fahrenheit).
5.	RelativeHumidity-Relative humidity (percent).
6.	WindSpeed-Wind speed (miles per hour).
7.	WindDirection-Wind direction from true north using compass directions.
8.	StationPressure-Atmospheric pressure (inches of Mercury; or ‘in Hg’).
9.	SeaLevelPressure- Sea level pressure (in Hg).
10.	Precip	Total-precipitation in the past hour (in inches).

There is two option available out of which one is used for manual file prediction and other is for already in prediction batch file.
We have to give the absolute path where the file is kept for production.

Once prediction is completed the file will be placed at prediction output file.
